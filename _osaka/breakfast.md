I've had those *thick, buttered toast* for a few days by now, sometimes with *steaming hot coffee*, other times with *iced coffee*. They taste good. Both the toast and the coffee. Indeed, they have no problems except being stubbornly unfullfilling. 
 
I've given up on finding hearty breakfast in Osaka. All the places I went to are too healthy. It seems that people don't really care about breakfast here. You see, if you eat a Japanese breakfast, you'll be eating rice, miso soup, pickled vegetables and grilled fish. The same kind of things you eat for lunch and dinner. Sure, there're other things you can eat for lunch like ramen or curry, and dinner is much more elaborate. But you know what I mean. I prefer to separate breakfast from lunch and dinner just as I prefer four seasons. So I've been eating at those 喫茶 places. Here're my observations:

* Old school. Some of them have been around for a while.
* You can find those old mahjong tables (see pictures below). 
* They offer breakfast sets. The price ranges from $3 to $10. 
* Background music is good. One place played Ella Fitzgerald. 
* Not smoke free. You'll inhale other customers' smokes.
* You get to watch and talk to the locals.
* Coffee is good. But no free refills.
* No western omelettes. I don't think they even serve fried or scrambled eggs.

People who never had an omelette of 5 eggs with cheese, sausage and fried potatoes are like people who never worked out. They don't know what they are missing. If you know a great breakfast place in Osaka. Let me know.
