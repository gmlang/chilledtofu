It's time to visit Japan. Having read all the books by Murakami (except the few ones that haven't been translated to English), I've become curious. I've never been a big reader growing up, so it's an interesting fact that I read so much Murakami. Murakami's characters never have to plan when the time comes for traveling. They just pack and go and they always have more than enough cash. Most of us cannot do that, and have to spend quite some time planning, especially if you're going to a different country for a longer period, like what I'm about to do.  

So I'm going to Japan, but where in Japan? Somewhere in the Kansai region. Why Kansai? Because I remember I was drooling when I was reading the part where Midori cooks Kansai dishes in [Norwegian Wood](http://amzn.to/2nJmTMh). Where in Kansai? Osaka. Because Osaka is the transportation hub of Kansai, and it's known for its delicious food and down-to-earth people. Plus, it's less expensive than the more famous cities like Tokyo or Kyoto. 

So I'm going to Osaka. I need to buy a plane ticket and I want to buy it cheap. The solution is [skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.com). It's very easy to use and I'm going to show you how I used it to find a cheaper flight to Osaka. You may not go to Osaka, but you can do what I did to find cheap flights to the places you'll go.

## Input 

![center](/assets/images/one-way-ticket-to-osaka/1.png)
As you can see from the screenshot, I have a very specific destination and departure date. If you are flexible with either or both, you can get really cheap flights. I mean dirt cheap ones that cost $34 or less. For example, if you're open for any destination (good for idea generation when you don't know where to go), enter or select "Everywhere" in the **To** box. If you're flexible with your departure date, click the **Depart** box and then **Whole month**, and select **Cheapest month** or any of the 12 months shown. Sometimes **Roundtrip** tickets are cheaper than **One way** tickets. Other times, buying **Multi-city** is cheaper than buying independently. So play with different inputs, and after you are done, click the green **Search flights** button. Skyscanner will return a screen like this.

You can select the cheapest airline at this point. Or you can filter the results by airlines by unchecking those small checkboxes in the sidebar. 

## Filter by Airlines
For example, I've heard good things about Korean airlines, but I've never flown with them before so I'd love to give it a try. Asiana Airline is a Korean airline company and its price is very competitive. The screen below shows the filtered result: Asiana Airline, $907.

## Cut the price even more
If you click the itinerary box (NOT the green select button), a screen will pop up showing you where your flight connects at. In my case, the first stop is Chicago O'Hare International airport (ORD).

I know I can take the Amtrak to Chicago for $37, so it might be cheaper to fly out from Chicago instead of Detroit. When I changed my departure city to Chicago and surely the price dropped to $642.

## Book
When you find what you want, just click the green **Select** button, a screen will pop up, listing the websites where you can buy the ticket. In my case, vayama offered the lowest price.
