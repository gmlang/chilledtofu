He devoured a whole chicken and a plate of fries just a moment ago. Now he is staring at the untouched salad and thinking about the brazilian girl. He's eaten a lot of chicken before, but this Portuguese roasted chicken meal is particularly satisfying, and it's cheap too. "Behind every delicious and cheap meal there's some serious happiness." His grandpa used to say. He's feeling it now. 

When it comes to food, he prefers to eat things he's familiar with. The most adventuous food he's eaten is sushi. Even when he went to Iceland, he ordered a burger and fries, which costed him twenty some bucks. 

When it comes to women, it's the opposite. He's attracted to the unfamiliar. So one day when the brazilian girl entered his life, he felt some serious happiness.
