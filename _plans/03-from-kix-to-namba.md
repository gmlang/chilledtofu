There're many kinds of discounted packages of train/subway tickets available, but most of them are designed for short term (7 days or less) tourists. Since I'll be staying in Japan for 3 months, the best choice for me is one train ticket from Kansai International Airport (KIX) to Osaka city. After some search, I found [Yokoso! Osaka Ticket](http://www.howto-osaka.com/en/ticket/ticket/yokoso.html), which I bought a couple of days ago online. It only cost me 1500 Yen (USD $13.21). Not only it'll take me from KIX to Namba station, located in the heart of Osaka. It also includes a 1-day unlimited pass for riding Osaka city subways, new trams and buses, as well as special discount for 32 tourist spots in Osaka such as Osaka Castle, Tsutenkaku Tower, Osaka Water Bus, Umeda Sky Building (Floating Garden Observatory), and Santa Maria (Bay Cruise).

The train is operated by Nankai Electric Railway, and you can buy the ticket directly at their [website](http://www1.nanka-e-tabi.com/NEREN/itemlist.aspx?sk=1&ib=YOT).
