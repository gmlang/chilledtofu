Murakami's characters usually don't plan much when the time calls for traveling. They just pack and go. I envy them as it takes a lot of time to plan a trip, especially when going far for long.

Having read almost all the books by Murakami, I'm intrigued. So I'm going to Japan. Where in Japan? Kansai region. Why Kansai? Because I drooled when I read how Midori prepared Kansai dishes in [Norwegian Wood](http://amzn.to/2nJmTMh). Where in Kansai? Osaka. Because Osaka is the nation's kitchen and the transportation hub of Kansai, and its people are open and down to earth. 

So I'm going to Osaka. The first thing is to buy a cheap plane ticket. Here comes [skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.com). It's easy to use and I'm going to show you how. You can follow the procedure I described below to find cheap flights to the places you'll go.

## Input

As you can see from the screenshot, I have a very specific destination and departure date. If you are flexible with either or both, you can get dirt cheap flights that cost $34 or less. For example, if you're up for any destination, enter or select "Everywhere" in the **To** box. If you're flexible with departure date, click the **Depart** box and then **Whole month**, and select **Cheapest month** or any of the 12 months shown. Also, sometimes **Roundtrip** tickets are cheaper than **One way** tickets. Other times, buying **Multi-city** is cheaper than buying independently. So play with different inputs, and after you are done, click the green **Search flights** button. Skyscanner will return a screen like this.

You can select the cheapest airline at this point. Or you can filter the results by airlines. Just uncheck those small checkboxes in the sidebar. 

## Filter by Airlines
For example, I've heard good things about Korean airlines, so I'd love to try them out. Asiana Airline is a Korean airline company and its price is very competitive. The screen below shows the filtered result: Asiana Airline, $907.

## Cut the price even more
If you click the itinerary box (NOT the green select button), a screen will pop up showing you where your flight connects at. In my case, the first stop is Chicago O'Hare International airport (ORD).

I know I can take the Amtrak to Chicago for $37, so it might be cheaper to fly out from Chicago instead of Detroit. And when I changed my departure city to Chicago and surely the price dropped to $642.

## Book it
When you find what you want, just click the green **Select** button, a screen will pop up, listing the websites where you can buy the ticket. In my case, vayama offered the lowest price.
