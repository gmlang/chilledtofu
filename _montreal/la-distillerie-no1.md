> Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.
>
> <cite>Haruki Murakami, [What I talk about when I talk about running](http://amzn.to/2snh3jy)</cite>

He met the brazilian girl at the University's pool. He had an entire lane by himself and enjoyed some 22 laps when she appeared. 

"Can I join you?" She asked him.

"Sure." He let her.

So they swam circles. Oh, boy. She was fast. He tried to keep up with her but couldn't. Finally he gave up after he had cramps in both legs. 

"How are you holding up?" She asked. 

"Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional." He grined.

"Hmm..., that's deep." She smiled half mockingly, "I wonder where you got that."

"Inspired by your great legs." He looked into her eyes.

Later that night he found out those legs came from many years of hard training, and she had also read the running book by Murakami.

"That's my favoriate book. Although I'm a swimmer not a runner, I experience the sensations he wrote in the book, both physically and mentally. And I really like his attitude." 

"Oh, yeah? What attitude?" 

"Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional." She repeated the same line he quoted in the pool, and they both laughed.

His brother once warned him about great legs, "they'll get to you every time." He remembered it when he first put his hands on her thighs. The sensation shook the core of his Self, and he felt the urge of going to the deep forest, digging up Pandora's box and letting hope out. 

When he was in high school, his brother drilled him hard with pull-ups. He'd make sure he felt pain. The pain often broke him and he'd cry. Later he went to college and eventually got a PhD. His brother never went to college. Instead, he was sent to Iraq, saw a guy blown up, came back and got skin cancer. 

He remembered how he used to caress those legs while she was giving him head. And when he was about to come, he'd grab her ankle and squeeze her pretty feet. 

But those legs swam away.
