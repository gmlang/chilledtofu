I've given up on finding hearty breakfast in Osaka. All the places I went are too healthy to be hearty. It seems that dinner is the most important meal here. And there's really no difference between Japanese breakfast, lunch and dinner. You eat pretty much the same thing. For example, a Japanese breakfast consists of rice, grilled fish, soup and some pickled vegetables. I prefer to keep breakfast different from dinner just as I prefer to live in a place with four seasons. So I've been eating at those 喫茶 places. Here're my observations:

* Some of the places have been around for a long time.
* Some place has those old mahjong table. 
* They usually offer breakfast sets. The price ranges from $3 to $10. 
* Background music is good. One place I went to played Ella Fitzgerald.
* Not smoke free. You'll inhale other customers' smokes.
* Coffee is really good. But you cannot get refills.
* The meal is not hearty enough.

Let me just say this. I think people who never had 5-egg omelette with cheese, sausages and potatoes are like people who never exercised. They simply don't know what they are missing. If you know a great breakfast place in Osaka. Let me know.
