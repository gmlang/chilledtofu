Before coming to Japan, I made some [web apps](https://chilledtofu.com/tools/) for finding good local restaurants. I haven't used them since I arrived. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't use them. :) I haven't needed to use them because I have a Japanese friend who can tell if a place is good by looking at its store front. To fully take advantage of his talent, we've been using the primitive way of finding food: walking and looking. In this age of Yelp and Tabelog, there's something thrilling about searching for food on foot, just as in this age of online dating, there's something attractive about randomly encountering a woman in a jazz bar. It'll take time, but that doesn't bother me at all. Like Cohen, I also "always liked it slow."[^1] 

The old ways still work and work the best sometimes. That's how we found Higashi, a small shop that just opened this month (July 2017). We would never have found it if we used Tabelog or Yelp. Their boiled pig feet is the best I ever had. The side dish is very tasty and it's free. The grilled meats shown below are various parts of a pig: tongue, shoulder and jaw. The white-colored drink is sweet and refreshing. It's called Calpico and it's good for the summer. 

After this satisfying meal of pork, we were on our feet again, looking for ramen. You can read about our random encounter [here](https://chilledtofu.com/osaka/junk-story/).
