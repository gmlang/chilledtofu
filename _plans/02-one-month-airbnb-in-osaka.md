One of my wordly pleasures is to sleep like a baby, rise up with the Sun, and boil hot water while listening to music. Once the water is boiled to 80 degrees, I'd pour it over coffee, Chinese tea or [mate](http://amzn.to/2nQe4AL), depending on the kind of work I'll be doing for that day. Coffee for writing, mate for data science, and Chinese tea for all the other. This is my morning ritual so the first things I look for when renting for intermediate stays (1 month+) are a real bed and a water boiler. I also need fast internet, a desk and a chair for work. And I want plenty of places nearby to eat and drink at and it should also be easy to get to other places by foot, subway, bus, or train. 

After extensive search, I found Yuji and Yoko's Airbnb in the heart of Osaka. Yuji and Yoko are Airbnb Superhost with 6 listings in total. All of them are entire apartment rentals and have a rating of 5 stars. I read all the reviews and found no negative ones. So I contacted them and got a response within minutes from Yoko. I double checked the internet speed with Yoko and requested a desk and chair to be put in for work, Yoko gladly accommodated my request. She was friendly and proactive, asking me to text her if I have questions or need anything. Her English was excellent which makes things much easier. Oh, there's one more thing, Yuji and Yoko are also foodies. You can check out [their Airbnb profile](https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/85469839) to learn more about them and see what other people have said about their properties and hosting.

I'm looking forward to sipping my morning coffee at Yuji and Yoko's Airbnb.
