Hey, look at what I ordered at Les Anges:

* Natas (pic 1)
* Dulce de leche (pic 2)
* Salted Cod/Shrimp Fritters (pic 3)
* Mochaccino (pic 4 & 5)

Oh, did I forget to tell you I also just had two smoked meat sandwiches for lunch? What? do I feel guilty? No, absolutely not. 
You see, life will probably never bring me back to this little pastry shop again, so I don't mind indulging myself a little bit. Just like when you know you'll never see that person again, you'll make love like mad or fight like mad dogs. Same idea. Plus, "Einmal ist keinmal." If I only eat here once, I might as well not have eaten here at all[^1]. So I feel perfectly justified. And I'll sweat it all out when I do my running routines. 

I sometimes run tracks with a good friend when I'm not traveling. He's a very smart guy but he has a really hard time appreciating "Einmal ist keinmal." For example, he'd tell me his running record for 1600 is 5:45 and it happened 2 years ago. I'd ask him how many times it happened. He'd say "record by definition only happens once." I'd say "Einmal ist keinmal." He'd say "When an athlete makes a record in the olympics, you don't erase it and say it never happened." I'd quote murakami "passing glory is no glory." He'd say "you don't apply that and 'once is never' to workouts." 

Actually, now I think about it, there is really one area you shouldn't apply "once is never" to, and that is the act of shitting, because most of us don't shit once, most of us shit once a day.
