One of my wordly pleasures is to sleep like a baby, rise up with the Sun, and boil hot water while listening to music. Once the water is boiled to 80-90 degrees, I'd pour it over coffee, [mate](http://amzn.to/2nQe4AL) or Chinese tea, depending on the type of work I'll be doing for that day. Coffee for writing, mate (in the Winter) or Chinese tea (in the non-Winter) for data science. This is my morning ritual so the first things I look for when renting for short term are a real bed and a water boiler. I also need fast internet, a desk and chair, and lots of restaurants nearby. 

After an extensive search, I found Yuji and Yoko's Airbnb in the heart of Osaka. Yuji and Yoko are Airbnb Superhost with 6 listings in total. All of them are entire apartment rentals with 5 stars. I read all the reviews and found no negative ones. So I contacted them and got a response within minutes from Yoko. I double checked the internet speed with Yoko and requested a desk and chair to be put in for work, Yoko gladly accommodated my request. She was friendly and proactive, asking me to text her if I have questions or need anything. Her English was excellent which makes things much easier. Oh, there's one more thing, Yuji and Yoko are also foodies. You can check out [their Airbnb profile](https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/85469839) to learn more about them and see what other people have said about their properties and hosting.

I'm looking forward to sipping my morning coffee/tea at Yuji and Yoko's Airbnb. If you're new to Airbnb, you can use [this link](https://www.airbnb.com/c/guangmingl26) to sign up and save **$40** on your first booking.
