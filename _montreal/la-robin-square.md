At la robin square, they serve a dish called the ultimate experience. It's pork belly and it's praised by people on yelp. I ordered it and regretted it after the first bite. The smoked skin wasn't that crispy, the meat wasn't melting, and it was very fatty. The ultimate experience turned out to be a disappointment. 

I used to go to this milonga at La Viruta in Buenos Aires. At the end of the night, which was usually 4 or 5 in the morning, the DJ would play a long and slow tango nuevo and dim the lights until complete darkness. That was the ultimate intimacy for the dancers. But what followed was La Cumparsita and all the lights turned on, big and bright lights, signaling the party was over. Under those big bright lights, I couldn't shake off the feeling of being exposed. Now I think about it, maybe the whole thing was a metaphor, maybe the price you have to pay for ultimate intimacy is exposure, and that's why people have trouble opening their hearts completely. 

My conclusion? Neither ultimate experience or ultimate intimacy can be trusted. But once in a while, we need to order that pork belly and dance the last dance. 

> Perhaps an even more distressing prospect for Habara than the cessation of sexual activity, however, was the loss of the moments of shared intimacy. To lose all contact with women was, in the end, to lose that connection. What his time spent with women offered was the opportunity to be embraced by reality, on the one hand, while neglecting it entirely on the other.

The good news was that their mac and cheese was fantastic. The best I ever had. It came with a small spoon of hot sauce that you can mix with. The hot sauce really made it for me. While I was eating the mac and cheese and drinking wine, I remmebered the french girl I met in Buenos Aires. She had grayish green eyes and a pretty nose. But she was clumpsy at tango. At the art museum, she announced, with all solemnity, that she loved theatre and wanted to become an actress. I was her only audience then. I wonder if she's commanding an larger audience now.
