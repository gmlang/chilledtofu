I asked her to dinner.  
"Are you a warrior?"   
She said,  
"Because I used to eat horse legs with the great Mongol Khan  
By the wild fire."  

I told her I wasn't a lover.  
She ordered an "easy to love" for me and  
got drunk on the cheap wine.  
I told her the poet was long dead.  
She said she knew.

Holding hands in the graveyard,  
We read words on the tombstones.  
Some people lived big and others died young.  
We didn't moralize among the dead.  
We smiled at the sun.

I took her to the theatre.  
We saw a little child and a white wolf.  
Up she went,  
Into the big screen.  
That's how I lost her.

I didn't look for her.   
I was young and proud.  
Forget about "easy to love."  
I wanted to become a Spartan.  
But I thought of her from time to time.  

But then again, how could you tell  
the wantings from the miswantings?  
There're times when you witness the outburst of desire.  
There're times when you hear the lullaby of despair.  
There're times when you feel the moonlight tides. 

"Come to the dance floor tomorrow night."  
I got a message from her yesterday, but  
I didn't go.  
I forgot how to embrace her body.  
I never learned how to caress her mind. 

I'm not old and I'm not young.  
I can't tell the wantings from the miswantings.  
The fire is no longer wild.  
The "easy to love" becomes too sweet.  
The great Khan, like the poet, is also dead.
