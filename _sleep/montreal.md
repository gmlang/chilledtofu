{% include gallery caption="Paolo's Airbnb" %}

* My stay: Fri, June 2 2017 - Tue, June 6 2017

* Total price per day (including all fees): $144

* Most valuable: great location. You could walk to all the interesting places: Lenoard Cohen's neighborhood (Saint Laurent Blvd, Main Deli Steakhouse, Schwartz's, Bagel Etc, and Parc de Portugal), Mount Royal, the old port, Chinatown and etc. 

The place was clean. The wifi was fast. The bed was comfortable. And there was a coffee maker/water boiler.
