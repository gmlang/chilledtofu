There're many kinds of discounted packages of train/subway tickets available, but most of them are designed for short term (7 days or less) tourists. Since I'll be staying in Japan for 3 months, the best choice for me is one train ticket from Kansai International Airport (KIX) to Osaka city. After some search, I found [Yokoso! Osaka Ticket](http://www.howto-osaka.com/en/ticket/ticket/yokoso.html), which I bought a couple of days ago online. It only cost me 1500 Yen (USD $13.21). Not only it'll take me from KIX to Namba station, located in the heart of Osaka. It also includes a 1-day unlimited pass for riding Osaka city subways, new trams and buses, as well as special discount for 32 tourist spots in Osaka such as Osaka Castle, Tsutenkaku Tower, Osaka Water Bus, Umeda Sky Building (Floating Garden Observatory), and Santa Maria (Bay Cruise).

The train is operated by Nankai Electric Railway, and you can buy the ticket directly at their [website](http://www1.nanka-e-tabi.com/NEREN/itemlist.aspx?sk=1&ib=YOT).

### Update

After you arrive at KIX, go out on the second floor and follow the signs to train and shuttle area. Before long, you'll see Nankai ticket office on your left and the entrance to train station on the right. Go to the ticket office (shown below) and show them the paper you printed out when you ordered your ticket online at home.

They will give you 4 tickets. The first ticket is not really a ticket but a printed instruction card of how the rest 3 tickets work. It looks like this.

The second ticket is the one you use to enter and exit the train station. The third ticket shows you the cart and seat number on the train. They look like this.

They'll also tell you what time your train will leave the station. For example, I arrived at 11 am, and the train they put me on was scheduled to leave at 11:35 am. Now you have your tickets, you can enter the train station. The picture below shows its entrance.

After you enter, if you keep going straight ahead, you will find restroom. If you want to ask where is the restroom, use the word "toilet" instead of "restroom." To get to the train platform, go downstairs and stand at the side of line 1. Look for this big sign.

Your train is blue with the word "Rapit" on it. The cart numbers are clearly printed on the train body.

If you don't see such a train, wait patiently until the departure time they told you. A blue train will appear. Once you get on the train, find your seat and enjoy the ride. The inside of the train looks like this.

The seat is comfortable and you can pull out a small table to put your drinks. There's also public wifi by the city of Osaka.
