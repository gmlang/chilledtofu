Bagel Etc, according to Cohen, is a great place to sit.  

![](/assets/images/montreal/bagel-etc/a-great-place-to-sit.jpg) 

It's a breakfast place. It has red booths, big-hat-shaped lamps and amazing Huevos Rancheros.   

I was seated at the back corner. I watched people come in and go out. I listened to their chatters. I liked the sound of French. The waitress brought me coffee. As she walked away, it dawned on me that people do grow old and die.

I started listening to Cohen when I was in college. Finally this year, I made to the age when Cohen began his music career. When you are a fan of someone at a young age, you worry one day they'll change to someone you don't like anymore. No, you don't worry about it then. You start to worry about it after you have lived some more years and changed yourself. Luckily, I like both Cohen the almost young and Cohen the old. From the early recordings to the last album, his voice got deeper and his tempo slowed down, but Cohen remained Cohen. He even aged gracefully. I wonder if he also died gracefully, but I can't imagine what a graceful death will look like.  

I don't think about death, although I almost died once. I'm still too young to think about death, and I'm too ignorant to think about after-death. My mom thinks about death. She hears its footsteps. That's why she keeps sending me junk articles on cancer prevention and longevity even after I tell her that I never read them. I think she feels death is coming and she's afraid of it. Because of that, she's afraid of getting sick, afraid of driving, afraid of traveling, afraid of cats, afraid of spending money, afraid of learning new things, ... She was a musician for 20 some years. Now she just lets the fear of death envelope her. It's hard to age gracefully.  

I met a homeless the other day and he told me something predictably human, "When we're little, we don't think. When we're young, we think about beauty and sex. When we're almost young, we think more about beauty, sex and money. When we're old, we think about all that and death."
