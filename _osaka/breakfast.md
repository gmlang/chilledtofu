I've been having the *thick, buttered toast* for the last many days, sometimes with *steaming hot coffee*, other times with coffee ice cold. They taste good, by they, I mean everything that comes in a set: the toast, the coffee, the boild egg and the unpeeled banana chunk, even the pretty little jars of milk and syrup. Each item is perfect in its own way, but once lined up on a tray and served together, they become stubbornly unfullfilling. 

When people are unfullfilled, they start asking questions. That's how, for example, Nicolaus Copernicus came up with the heliocentric model, how Isaac Newton discovered the law of motions, and how Charles Darwin cracked open the natural selection process. So don't be offended by my act of inquiry because it's only natural and perfectly human. Plus, my questions are a lot simpler:

* Why couldn't the eggs be fried, scrambled or made into an omelette?
* Why couldn't the toast be farm bread, sourdough or some other kind like apricot with almond seed?
* Why couldn't there be sausage, bacon and fried potatoes mixed with different kinds of spices?
* Why couldn't there be green arugulas, red tomatoes, and yellow peppers?
* Who moved the cheese?

Friend, let me tell you something: I've given up on finding hearty breakfast in Osaka. Notice the keyword here is "hearty" not "healthy." All the places I tried are healthy, healthy in a bad way. For one, people here don't seem to care about breakfast. You see, if you eat a Japanese breakfast, you'll be eating rice, miso soup, pickled vegetables and grilled fish. The same kind of things you eat for lunch and dinner. Sure, there're other things you can eat for lunch, and dinner is much more elaborate. But you know what I mean. I prefer to eat very different things for breakfast and dinner, just like most people don't introduce their lovers to their spouses. So I've been eating buttered toasts at those 喫茶 places. Here're my observations:

* Old school, from background music to interior setup. Some cafe has been around for a while.
* Some have those old electronic mahjong tables (pictures below). Taka told me playing those mahjong table is a big pastime for people of older generation. That reminded me of Murakami's [*Pinball, 1973*](http://amzn.to/2eKyMP1).
* They offer breakfast sets. The price ranges from $3 to $10. 
* Not smoke free. You'll inhale other customers' smokes. The good thing is that almost all customers are locals. They are friendly.  You can try to talk to them and have a good time. 
* Coffee is good. But no free refills.

## Update

People who never had a big and salty and fatty breakfast are like people who never worked out. They don't know what they are missing.

When I said I gave up on finding hearty breakfast, I lied. I kept looking. 

To be continued.
