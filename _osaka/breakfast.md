> I went on silently trudging along the train tracks, lost in dreams of strong, steaming hot coffee and slices of thick, buttered toast.

> <cite>Haruki Murakami, [A Walk to Kobe](https://granta.com/a-walk-to-kobe/)</cite>

I've been having the *thick, buttered toast* for the last many days, sometimes with *steaming hot coffee*, other times with coffee ice cold. They taste good, by they, I mean everything that comes in a set: the toast, the coffee, the boild egg and the unpeeled banana chunk, even the pretty little jars of milk and syrup. Each item is perfect in its own way, but once lined up on a tray and served together, they become stubbornly unfullfilling. 

When people are unfullfilled, they start asking questions. That's how, for example, Nicolaus Copernicus came up with the heliocentric model, how Isaac Newton discovered the law of motions, and how Charles Darwin cracked open the natural selection process. So don't be offended by my act of inquiry because it's only natural and perfectly human. Plus, my questions are a lot simpler:

* Why couldn't the eggs be fried, scrambled or made into an omelette?
* Why couldn't the toast be farm bread, sourdough or some other kind like apricot with almond seed?
* Why couldn't there be sausage, bacon and fried potatoes mixed with different kinds of spices?
* Why couldn't there be green arugulas, red tomatoes, and yellow peppers?
* Who moved the cheese?

Friend, let me tell you something: I've given up on finding hearty breakfast in Osaka. Notice the keyword here is "hearty" not "healthy." All the places I tried are healthy, healthy in a bad way. For one, people here don't seem to care about breakfast. You see, if you eat a Japanese breakfast, you'll be eating rice, miso soup, pickled vegetables and grilled fish. The same kind of things you eat for lunch and dinner. Sure, there're other things you can eat for lunch, and dinner is much more elaborate. But you know what I mean. I prefer to eat very different things for breakfast and dinner, just like most people don't introduce their lovers to their spouses. So I've been eating buttered toasts at those 喫茶 places. Here're my observations:

* Old school, from background music to interior setup. Some cafe has been around for a while.
* Some have those old electronic mahjong tables (pictures below). Taka told me playing those mahjong table is a big pastime for people of older generation. That reminded me of Murakami's [*Pinball, 1973*](http://amzn.to/2eKyMP1).
* They offer breakfast sets. The price ranges from $3 to $10. 
* Not smoke free. You'll inhale other customers' smokes. The good thing is that almost all customers are locals. They are friendly.  You can try to talk to them and have a good time. 
* Coffee is good. But no free refills.

## A Memorable Bad Meal

People who never had a big and salty and fatty breakfast are like people who never worked out. They don't know what they are missing.

When I said I gave up on finding hearty breakfast, I lied. Unsatisfied desires hunt. That's how I noticed the sign of Eggs'n Things on my way to [live house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_house) with Lee the other night. Lee is a 4th generation Korean Japanese born in Osaka. Using his own words, he is "deep local." He has a bar called A769 and that's where we met. The story of Lee and his bar deserves an article of its own, which I'll write soon. Now back to Eggs'n Things. It's a chain restaurant, and I normally don't go to chain restaurants. But my desire for a big and hearty breakfast was so strong that I went the next day anyway, and sure enough it was a disaster. Just look at the shape of the omelette. It's flat like a board. And look at the two pieces of bread. They are the pathetic soft kind that stays placcid no matter how you toast it. When I lift the top layer of the omelette, I saw some meager kalua pork. The omelette was watery and the coffee tasted burned. To make it worse, the entire meal cost me $16.87 USD.

## Finally Satisfied

Having had such a memorable bad meal, I'm on the hunt for good breakfast full time. Thanks to Google. It didn't take me long to find one: Westwood Bakers. I ordered their fried egg, cheese and bacon breakfast sandwich set that includes coffee. The first bite hit the spot right away. It then dawned on me that it is really the bread that makes or breaks a great breakfast. At Westwood Bakers, they bake their own bread, delicious bread. Just look at this picture, don't you also want a bite?

Because it was so good, I also ordered their walnut and raisin bread with butter. It was also very delicious.

There was a cute girl there who spoke excellent English because she studied in the US. She told me I was lucky because she normally works at the Burger shop owned by the same owner. I said I'd better use my good luck well then. That's how I got a photo of her smile.

She asked me how I wanted my coffee. I told her I always liked it dark. She said, "I meant hot or iced." I said, "I know." I also told her to really take her time. She laughed and said, "ok, how about 30 years?"

If you are in Osaka, you should come by this place, for the bread  or for the smile. The bread will always be there. The smile? Well, my friend, you need to count on your luck.
