I found L'Escalier by chance. It's a hideout with a name true to itself. I had to climb some stairs to get to it.

"These are some narrow stairs. L'esprit de l'escalier." I said to myself in my head as I climbed the stairs. Then I remembered a friend who once told me he'd gotten the staircase wit. Next I thought of a girl I chance encountered in the gym who told me she was learning French. "What's her name?" I wondered in my head, but I didn't think she told me. "It seemed more important for her to tell me she was learning French. Why?"

"L'Escalier, staircase and staircase wit." I murmured as I approached the bar.

It was my first night in Montreal. I flew in around noon, had some smoked meat and did some work. By the time I finished, it was already 10 at night. I was hungery and wanted a drink. So I yelped and found L'Escalier only two blocks away.

At the bar, the menu was in French, and I ordered like a soldier without hesitation. Not because I could speak the language, but because I google translated the menu and made up my mind before climbing up those stairs. These were the things I ordered:

* Trio classique (2 person size)
* Pastis La Mauresque
* Boréale blonde

The Trio Classique was truely amazing.

On Yelp:

* [L'Escalier](https://www.yelp.com/biz/l-escalier-montréal-2). Cash (Canadian dollars) only. No cover. Cheap and hip. The [menu](http://lescalier-montreal.com/restaurant-bar/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Menu-2016-FINI-222.pdf) is entirely in French.

* [Feel Family](http://lescalier-montreal.com/restaurant-bar/?tribe_events=feel-family-funk-jazz-trance-et-hip-hop-27). A jazz, funk and hip-hop band. They played at L'Escalier the night I went, and I liked their stuff. The sound of the youtube videos aren't good. Their live performance is much better. Go to see them if you can.
