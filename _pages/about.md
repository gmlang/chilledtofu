Hello, 你好, こんにちは, 

Welcome to my travel blog. I'm chilled tofu and I'll be your tour guide and connoisseur. Through this blog, I'll take you with me to the places I'll go. I'll share with you the planning and the actual experiences of my travels so that if you ever plan to go to the same places, you don't have to spend time looking for **where to eat** and **sleep** and **how to get around**. I'll do the research, experiment, and document my experiences, and I'll present to you only the most useful information. All you need to do is to read this blog and be on you way.

## A little about me
I'm a freelance data scientist, and I work in front of my Mac and over the internet. I love my work. I also love swimming, rowing, reading, and playing the ukulele. On top of all that, I love amazing food and a good night of sleep.
