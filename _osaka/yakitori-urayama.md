We walked one street after another, looking for the perfect Yakitori. If I tell you how long we walked, you'd look at me and say most people don't operate like that. Well, that says something about me and Taka. Taka, my Japanese friend, is a perfectionist with a tendency for optimization, while I have outgrown my restless youth and acquired the virtue of patience. 

We must've walked one hour or so. Finally, we saw a place looked promising, but it was so full that they didn't even know when they could seat us. I was a bit bummed out. Little did I know then that I was about to eat some of the very best Yakitori moments later. Yes, life throws at you curveballs like that. Once at Berthoud Pass in Denver Colorado, I slipped off a cliff and got strangled in the snow, and just when I lost my strength, I chanced upon a ladder under a tree. It saved my life. I'll go into the details of that story at another time. My point is that since then, I learned to pay attention to the curveballs. Not all of them are good. But without them, Life would be dull. Plus, we can't pick and choose anyway. 
 
So we continued to walk, and within 10 steps, we were in front of a Yakitori joint. We slided the door open and got in. It was a tiny place. If you look at the pictures below, you wouldn't be able to imagine how tiny it was. It was owned by a husband and wife. The husband does the grill and the wife helps. I've been in Osaka for 8 days and had Yakitori at multiple places, so far, no other places beat this little joint. Taka agrees with me.

If you ever chance encounter this little Yakitori joint, order items with orange circles on the menu (picture 7) because these are their specialties. In particular, you must try the minced chicken (picture 4). This is the dish they are proud of and they make it with their own secrete ingredients. This is also my favorite. My second favorite is the chicken bones (picture 3).
