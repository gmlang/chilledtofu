I thought of this quote when I was researching for travel insurance. If subconsciously I want to get away from myself through this Japan trip, buying travel insurance proves that I've failed at it. But the good news is that it didn't take me much time to decide where to buy it from: [World Nomads](https://www.worldnomads.com/travel-insurance/). If you google around, you'll find its popularity, for example, [Nomadlist](https://nomadlist.com) recommends it. Its price is also very reasonable. It cost me $335 (standard plan) for 6 months in Japan and Taiwan. You can read the details of its coverage on their website after filling in your travel info and clicking the "Get a Price" button.
