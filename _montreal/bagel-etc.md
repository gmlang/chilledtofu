Bagel Etc, according to Cohen, is a great place to sit.  

![](/assets/images/montreal/bagel-etc/a-great-place-to-sit.jpg) 

It's a breakfast place. It has red booths, lamps like big hats and amazing Huevos Rancheros.   

I've listened to a lot of Cohen, from his early recordings to his last album. Sitting at the back corner and looking at the big-hat-shaped lamps, it dawned on me that people do grow old and die.
