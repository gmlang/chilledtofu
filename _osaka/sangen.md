Osaka is good, but it has been hard for me to find a decent place to work out. This morning I did a run at Nakanoshima Park, and it wasn't good. But on my way back, I discovered restaurant Sangen. I was sold the moment I saw the words "since 1936." A restaurant of 81 years old! That's a no-brainer. 

We went there for lunch. Taka ordered their special pork over rice (picture 1) that cost only 1200 yen. The shredded green leaves are Japanese basil, which has a flowery and minty taste. I ordered the lunch set which was more substantial and came with a coffee at the end. Even the coffee was excellent.

The owner and chef spent 1 month in Australia 20 years ago and surprisingly retained enough English to communicate with me. He told me his grandpa opened the restaurant and it passed down to his father and then to him. The menu also evolved over the years.

It's a nice place. You should try.

On Tabelog (Japanese Yelp):

* [Sangen](https://tabelog.com/en/osaka/A2701/A270201/27003946/). It has a rating of 3.58 with 98 reviews, which is more like a 4 or 4.5 on Yelp as the Japanese are very picky about giving high ratings. Feel free to try any restaurant on Tabelog with a rating of 3.5+ and many reviews. It'll be good.
