I thought of this quote when I was buying travel insurance for my Asia trip. If I wanted to get away from myself, would I still think about travel insurance? I don't know, but I know I'd tell the story like this

> Years ago, when I was *almost young*[^1], I wanted to get away from myself by traveling far, and I didn't forget to buy travel insurance. 

That's that. 

I bought the standard plan from [World Nomads](https://www.worldnomads.com/travel-insurance/). The price was reasonable, for example, it cost me $335 for 6 months in Japan and Taiwan. You can read what people (digital nomads) said about their experiences with the claim process [here](https://nomadforum.io/t/how-are-your-experiences-with-world-nomads-travel-insurance/6299/8).
